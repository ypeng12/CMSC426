1.(a) **Smoothing Kernel:**
A smoothing kernel is used for blurring or smoothing an image by reducing its noise and details. A common example is the Gaussian Kernel. A 3x3 Gaussian kernel might look like this:

\[\frac{1}{16} \begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 1 \\2 & 4 & 2 \\1 & 2 & 1\end{pmatrix}\]



1.(b) **Sharpening Kernel:**
A sharpening kernel is used to enhance the edges within an image. One commonly used sharpening kernel is the Laplacian kernel. A 3x3 Laplacian kernel can be represented as:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1 & 0 \\
-1 & 5 & -1 \\
0 & -1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

2. **ANMS Algorithm:**
ANMS (Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression) algorithm is utilized to select a subset of interest points that are distributed as uniformly as possible over the image domain. In essence, it's a technique to ensure that the selected points are not clustered in one region of the image but are spread out evenly.

3. **GMM and Color Class Prior:**
In Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for image thresholding, a common choice for the prior distribution of a color class could be a Dirichlet distribution. The Dirichlet distribution is a conjugate prior of the multinomial distribution and can be useful in this context to model the probability of a pixel belonging to a particular color class.
